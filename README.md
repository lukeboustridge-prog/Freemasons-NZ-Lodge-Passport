# Freemasons NZ Passport - full app

This repository is a minimal Vite React TypeScript app with Tailwind and the updated Passport UI.

## Quick start

1. Clone or upload to GitHub, then install:
   ```bash
   npm i
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

The app includes:
- Dashboard with separate sections for memberships, lodge offices, and grand lodge offices
- Milestones with compact collapsible rows and inline edit
- Visits with compact collapsible rows and inline add and edit
- FMNZLogo component pointing to the correct URL with a local fallback

Replace the placeholder state in `App.tsx` with your API store when ready.
